# Neural Network Project in Python

## Description
This project focuses on building and training a neural network using Python. It's structured to provide a clear workflow from data preprocessing to model evaluation.

## Setup and Installation

### Requirements
- Python 3.7 or later
- Virtual environment (recommended)

### Installation Steps
1. **Clone the Repository:**
git clone https://github.com/xlysova/NS_projectZP.git

2. **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment:**
- **Windows:**
  ```
  python -m venv myenv
  myenv\Scripts\activate
  ```
- **Unix/MacOS:**
  ```
  python -m venv myenv
  source myenv/bin/activate
  ```
3. **Install Dependencies:**
pip install -r requirements.txt


## Project Structure

- `main.py` - Entry point of the application.
- `data_loader.py` - Handles data loading and preprocessing.
- `model.py` - Defines the neural network architecture.
- `train.py` - Manages the training process of the model.
- `evaluate.py` - For evaluating the model's performance.
- `utils.py` - Contains utility functions used across the project.
- `/data` - Directory for storing datasets.
- `/notebooks` - Jupyter notebooks for experimentation (optional).

## Usage

Run the project using:
python main.py
